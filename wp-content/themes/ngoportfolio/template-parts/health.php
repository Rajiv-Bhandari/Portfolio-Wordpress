                        Our efforts to enhance health in villages encompass various initiatives. We ensure the availability of essential medicines to those in need, conducting educational programs to promote better health practices, and spreading awareness regarding healthcare essentials.
                        Moreover, our organization strongly advocates for menstrual health and hygiene, distributing free sanitary pads among young girls to support their well-being and education.
